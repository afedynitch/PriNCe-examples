# PriNCe-examples

This repository contains examples for the use of the PriNCe propagation code.

Requires the base [PriNCe code](https://github.com/joheinze/PriNCe) and the [PriNCe analysis tools](https://github.com/joheinze/PriNCe-analysis-tools). The latter is optional, since it is only used for plotting measured spectra.
